game description: 
The year is 2023 and the coronavirus has spiraled out of control and put the world in total chaos, instead of mild symptoms such as coughing people are now turning into flesh eating zombies! You, one of the last people alive yet to be infected by the virus has been sent out on a mission to save what remains of humanity. You and your tank are the only thing that stands between total extinction or survival. To rescue humanity, you must shoot the zombies in your way and pick up survivors. Don’t forget to evade objects so you don’t crash and break the tank.  Stay alive by picking up more hearts and fuel for your tank. 

- pick up survivours with your tank to rescue them
- shoot the zombies before they reach the sideboard, if they do you will lose a survivor.
- avoid obstacels, if you hit them you tank will lose a life. 
-  Hitting the boss-zombie with your tank or if it reaches the sideboard it will be game-over. 
- pick up fuel-bottels before your tank runs out of fuel, when you run out it will be game-over.
